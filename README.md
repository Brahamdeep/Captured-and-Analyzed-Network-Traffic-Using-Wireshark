# 📡 Wireshark Network Traffic Capture & Analysis

## 📝 Objective

Capture live network traffic using Wireshark and identify basic protocols and traffic types such as DNS, TCP, ICMP, and TLS.

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Wireshark**
- **Operating System:** Windows

---

## 📌 Steps Followed

1. Installed and launched Wireshark.
2. Started packet capture on the active network interface.
3. Opened a website and ran `ping google.com` to generate traffic.
4. Stopped capture after approximately one minute.
5. Used filters like `dns`, `tcp`, `icmp`, and `tls` to analyze the traffic.
6. Identified and recorded at least 3 different protocols.
7. Exported the packet capture as a `.pcapng` file.
8. Created a short analysis report summarizing the findings.

## 📄 Deliverables

- `packet_capture.pcapng` – Captured traffic file
- `report.md` – Summary of protocols and packet details
- `README.md` – This documentation

---

## ✅ Protocols Observed

- **DNS** – Domain resolution queries
- **TCP** – Connection-based traffic
- **ICMP** – Ping (echo request/reply)
- **TLS** – Encrypted HTTPS communication

## 📚 Outcome

Gained hands-on experience with Wireshark, practiced real-time traffic analysis, and improved understanding of common network protocols.
